- [MSE](./MSE) Predict host load several-step-ahead measured with average MSE(Mean Squared Error) in Google Cluster Data.
- [MSSE](./MSSE) Predict host load over a long period measured with average MSSE(Mean Segment Squared Error) in Google Cluster Data.
- [autoencoder](./autoencoder) Add an autoencoder before the original ESN model.
- [grid](./grid) Only predict the MSE in Grid dataset.
